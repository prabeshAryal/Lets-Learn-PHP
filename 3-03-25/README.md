# March 3, 2025 - PHP Functions and Tasks

This directory contains PHP exercises focused on functions and task-based programming.

## Directory Structure

- `functions/`: Contains reusable PHP functions and utilities
- `task/`: Contains task-based PHP exercises and implementations

## What You'll Learn

- Creating and using PHP functions
- Organizing code into reusable components
- Task-based problem solving in PHP
- Structuring PHP projects with subdirectories

## How to Use

1. Explore the `functions/` directory to see reusable PHP functions
2. Explore the `task/` directory for specific exercises and implementations
3. Run individual PHP files using:
   ```bash
   php filename.php
   ```
   Or use PHP's built-in server:
   ```bash
   php -S localhost:8000
   ```

## Learning Objectives

- Write and use PHP functions
- Organize code for reusability
- Solve problems using task-based approaches
- Understand project structure in PHP

## Notes

- Functions are designed to be reused across multiple tasks
- Tasks demonstrate practical applications of PHP functions
- Experiment with the code to reinforce your learning
- Add your own functions and tasks to extend the exercises

## Best Practices

- Write modular and reusable code
- Comment your functions and tasks
- Test your code thoroughly
- Keep your project structure organized
